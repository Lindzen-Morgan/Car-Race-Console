# Car-Race-Console
This project demonstrates a basic race simulation where multiple cars compete to complete a predefined distance. The simulation includes random events that can impact each car's progress and allow user interaction to observe the race.

Usage
Run the program to start the race simulation.
The cars will begin racing, and random events will occur periodically.
Press "S" to see the distances of all cars at any time.
Press "Escape" to exit the simulation.
