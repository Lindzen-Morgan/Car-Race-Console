# Car-Race-Console
This project demonstrates a basic race simulation where multiple cars compete to complete a predefined distance. The simulation includes random events that can impact each car's progress and allow user interaction to observe the race.

 1. Run the program to start the race simulation. (Car-Race) 2. Press "S" to see the distances of all cars at any time. 3. The cars will begin racing, and random events will occur periodically. 4. Press "Escape" to exit the simulation.
